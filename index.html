Hi, My name is Pofeng Lee.

<p>
I joined the online community via FidoNet since 1992, and began to use Linux since 1994. Around 1998, I helped to do some internationalization / localization stuff in Linux. We formed a small project named CLE ( Chinese Linux Extension ). I also contributed a small module(patch) in the Chinese input method (xcin).

After I finished my medical resident program, I set up my own clinic. And then I came back to join the open source community again. In 2006, I helped to organize the first COSCUP  ( the Conference for Open Source Coders, Users and Promoters ). Now it is the largest OSS conference in Taiwan. During 2009, I helped android-x86.org to build a web site by Google sites and did some Search Engine Optimization. In 2011, I set up a small company to deal with the cash flow in COSCUP.
